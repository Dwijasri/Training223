		if(condition){
			block of code
		}

        let b=5
        if(a<b){
            document.write("Yay!!","<br>")

Q)Write a program that reads the scores A and B of two players and checks if one of the scores is greater than 300 and sum of the scores is less than 500.

Input: the first line of input contains an integer representing the score A. and the second line of input contains an integer representing the score B.

Output: the output should be a single line containing a string

Code:
let a= prompt("Score of A: ")
        let b= prompt("Score of B: ")
        let c=a+b
        if(a>300 || b>300 && c<500){
            alert("Can team up")
        }else{
            alert("Cannot team up")
        }
