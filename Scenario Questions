Senario 1: Voting eligibility system

You are tasked with building a system to check whether a person is eligible to vote. the system follows these rules:

1.A person must be at least 18 years old to vote
2.If the person is a citizen, they are eligible to vote
3.If the person is not a citizen, but has passed the citizenship test then they are eligible to vote
4.If the person is under 18, they cannot vote

        let age = parseInt(prompt("Enter age: "))
        let citizen = prompt("Are you a citizen (Yes/No) ? ")
        if(age>18 && citizen=='Yes'){
            document.write("Eligible to vote")
        }
        else if(citizen=="No"){
            let test= prompt("Did you pass the citizenship test (Yes/No) ?")
            if(test=="Yes"){
                document.write("Eligible to vote")
            }
            else{
                document.write("Not eligible to vote")
            }
        }
        if(age<18){
            document.write("Not eligible to vote")
        }


Scenario 2: Discount

let amount_spent=parseFloat(prompt("Enter amount spent: "))
        let premimum=prompt("Are you a premium member (Yes/No)?")
        if(amount_spent>100 && premimum=="No"){
            let dicsount=amount_spent*0.2
            let price=amount_spent-dicsount
            document.write("Price after discount "+price)
        }
        else if((amount_spent>50 && amount_spent<=100) && premimum=="No"){
            let dicsount=amount_spent*0.1
            let price=amount_spent-dicsount
            document.write("Price after discount "+price)
        }
        else if(amount_spent>100 && premimum=='Yes'){
            let dicsount=amount_spent*0.25
            let price=amount_spent-dicsount
            document.write("Price after discount "+price)
        }
        else if((amount_spent>50 && amount_spent<=100) && premimum=="Yes"){
            let dicsount=amount_spent*0.15
            let price=amount_spent-dicsount
            document.write("Price after discount "+price)
        }
