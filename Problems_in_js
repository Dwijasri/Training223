Program solving with JavaScript:

1. Write a program to check whether the number is divisible by 2 and 3 and both (take prompt)

let a= prompt("Enter number: ")
        let a= prompt("Enter number: ")
        if(a%2==0 && a%3==0){
            alert(a+" is divisible by 2 and 3")
        }else if(a%2==0){
            alert(a+" is divisible by 2")
        }else if(a%3==0){
            alert(a+" is divisible by 3")
        }else{
            alert(a+" is not divisible by 2 and 3")
        }

2. Write a program to find the largest number of the three numbers 

let a=parseInt(prompt("Enter num 1"))
        let b=parseInt(prompt("Enter num 2"))
        let c=parseInt(prompt("Enter num 3"))
        if(a>b && a>c){
            alert(a+" is the largest")
        }else if(b>a && b>c){
            alert(b+" is the largest")
        }else{
            alert(c+" is the largest")
        }

3. Accept the following from the user and calculate the percentage of classes attended
	a) total number of working days
	b) total number of days of absence
   After calculating percentage show that, if the percentage is less than 75, then student will not
   be eligible to write exam.

let working_days=parseInt(prompt("Enter the number of working days"))
        let absence=parseInt(prompt("Enter the number of days of absence"))
        let presence=working_days-absence
        let percentage=(presence/working_days)*100
        if(percentage>=75){
            alert("You are eligible for writing exam")
        }else{
            alert("You are not eligible for writing the exam")
        }

4. A company decided to give bonus to employee according to the following criteria:
	time 				bonus
	more than 10 years		10%
	>=6 years and <=10		8%
	less the 6			5%
   ask the user for their salary and years of experience and print the bonus amount

let salary=parseInt(prompt("Enter salary"))
        let years=parseInt(prompt("Enetr years"))
        
        if(years>10){
            let b=salary*10/100
            let bonus=b+salary
            alert("Your current salary is "+salary+" your salary with bonus is "+bonus)
            
        }else if(years>=6 && years<=10){
            let b=salary*8/100
            let bonus=b+salary
            alert("Your current salary is "+salary+" your salary with bonus is "+bonus)
            
        }else{
            let b=salary*6/100
            let bonus=b+salary
            alert("Your current salary is "+salary+" your salary with bonus is "+bonus)
        }
