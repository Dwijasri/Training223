Full Stack Development:
 End-to-End application development.
 1) Front end
 2) Back end
 3) Databases


DAY 1:

1)Front end:- User interface; visible part of application
  -HTML: Hypertext markup language
	text - content
	hypertext - text with multiple links
	markup - consists tags to create content on website
	--HTML is used to create structure of the contents that are displayed in an application

  -CSS: Cascading Style Sheet
	--used to add style to website; make website to look attractive
	1.font    	4.shape
	2.color   	5.size         
	3.position	6.etc.
	
  -Java Script: used to create dynamic websites; form validations
	1.static websites: interface remains constant for everyone
	2.dynamic websites: changes depending on the user

DAY 2:
JavaScript: scripting language; high level programming language; weakly/loosely typed language; lightweight and dynamic language; used to build user interface.
- introduced in 1995 by Brenden eich; Netscape navigator; first js program was developed within 7-8 days with the name mocha.
- applications: mobile, smartwatch, web apps, server side apps, gaming

Types of variables in JS: var, let, const. 


Day 3:
Variables:- 
	1. Case-sensitive
	2. start with letters, _(under score), $(dollar)
	3. cannot start with numbers
	4. Reserved(key) words are not allowed
	5. Allow letters, numbers, underscore, dollar
	a. Reassigning variables with var is accepted
	b. Reassigning with let is accepted
	c. Reassigning with const is not accepted
	i. Redeclaring with var is accepted
	ii. redeclaring with let is not accepted
	iii. Redeclaring with const is not accepted

Block Scope:
	1. Variables declared with var do not have block scope
	2. Variables declared with let have block scope


Day 5:
JavaScript operators:
	1. Arithmetic: +, -, *, /, %, **, ++, --
	<body>
    	   <script>
        	let a=5
        	let b=10
        	document.write(b%a, "<br>")
        	document.write(b/a, "<br>")
        	document.write(b**a, "<br>")
        	a++
        	document.write(a, "<br>")
        	b--
        	document.write(b)
    	   </script>
	</body>

	2. Assignment: =, +=, -=
	let a=5
        let b=10
        a+=20
        document.write(a, "<br>")
        b-=2
        document.write(b)

	3. Logical: and(&&), or(||), not(!)
	let a=5
        let b=10
        document.write(a>b && a>10, "<br>")
        document.write(a>b || a>10, "<br>")
        document.write(a!=b )

	4. Relational: >, <, ==, !=, <=, >=, ===, !==
	let a=10
        let b='10'
        document.write(a==b, "<br>")
        document.write(a===b, "<br>")
        document.write(a!==b, "<br>")
        document.write(a!=b, "<br>")
        document.write(a<=b, "<br>")
        document.write(a<b, "<br>")

	5. Conditional: Ternary (?)
	let a=10
        let b=(a>10) ? "Ac-off":"AC-on"
        document.write(b)

Window Methods:
	1. alert()
	alert("OH NO!!")
        console.log(alert)

	2. prompt()
	let name=prompt("Enter alert message")
        alert(name)
	
	let a=prompt()
        let b=prompt()
        document.write(typeof(a))
        console.log(a+b)

Day 6: 

Conditional Statements:
	executing the instructions only when the given condition is true. used to decide whether the condition is 	executed or skipped.
	Block of code: set of instructions
	Condition: an expression that evaluates a result
	Methods: if, if-else, else if, switch, ternary
	1. if:
		if(condition){
			block of code
		}
	Example: positive condition
	let a=4
        let b=5
        if(a<b){
            document.write("Yay!!","<br>")
        }
        document.write("Execute Anyway")
	
	Example: negative condition
	let a=4
        let b=5
        if(a>b){
            document.write("Yay!!","<br>")
        }
        document.write("Execute Anyway")

Q)Write a program that reads the scores A and B of two players and checks if one of the scores is greater than 300 and sum of the scores is less than 500.

Input: the first line of input contains an integer representing the score A. and the second line of input contains an integer representing the score B.

Output: the output should be a single line containing a string

Code:
let a= prompt("Score of A: ")
        let b= prompt("Score of B: ")
        let c=a+b
        if(a>300 || b>300 && c<500){
            alert("Can team up")
        }else{
            alert("Cannot team up")
        }

Day 7:

Program solving with JavaScript:

1. Write a program to check whether the number is divisible by 2 and 3 and both (take prompt)

let a= prompt("Enter number: ")
        let a= prompt("Enter number: ")
        if(a%2==0 && a%3==0){
            alert(a+" is divisible by 2 and 3")
        }else if(a%2==0){
            alert(a+" is divisible by 2")
        }else if(a%3==0){
            alert(a+" is divisible by 3")
        }else{
            alert(a+" is not divisible by 2 and 3")
        }

2. Write a program to find the largest number of the three numbers 

let a=parseInt(prompt("Enter num 1"))
        let b=parseInt(prompt("Enter num 2"))
        let c=parseInt(prompt("Enter num 3"))
        if(a>b && a>c){
            alert(a+" is the largest")
        }else if(b>a && b>c){
            alert(b+" is the largest")
        }else{
            alert(c+" is the largest")
        }

3. Accept the following from the user and calculate the percentage of classes attended
	a) total number of working days
	b) total number of days of absence
   After calculating percentage show that, if the percentage is less than 75, then student will not
   be eligible to write exam.

let working_days=parseInt(prompt("Enter the number of working days"))
        let absence=parseInt(prompt("Enter the number of days of absence"))
        let presence=working_days-absence
        let percentage=(presence/working_days)*100
        if(percentage>=75){
            alert("You are eligible for writing exam")
        }else{
            alert("You are not eligible for writing the exam")
        }

4. A company decided to give bonus to employee according to the following criteria:
	time 				bonus
	more than 10 years		10%
	>=6 years and <=10		8%
	less the 6			5%
   ask the user for their salary and years of experience and print the bonus amount

let salary=parseInt(prompt("Enter salary"))
        let years=parseInt(prompt("Enetr years"))
        
        if(years>10){
            let b=salary*10/100
            let bonus=b+salary
            alert("Your current salary is "+salary+" your salary with bonus is "+bonus)
            
        }else if(years>=6 && years<=10){
            let b=salary*8/100
            let bonus=b+salary
            alert("Your current salary is "+salary+" your salary with bonus is "+bonus)
            
        }else{
            let b=salary*6/100
            let bonus=b+salary
            alert("Your current salary is "+salary+" your salary with bonus is "+bonus)
        }
